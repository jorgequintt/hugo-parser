# hugo parser
A python script to parse simple html files into hugo projects. With this script you can quickly create a hugo website with an admin panel given a simple html template.

This script offers a syntax inside the html files so you can mark content (as lists of data, objects, variables, etc). The script then creates a "database" and sets everything up for modification on the admin panel, which is a very tedious task if you have a lot of data.

This project was developed for personal use, so there's no documentation.
